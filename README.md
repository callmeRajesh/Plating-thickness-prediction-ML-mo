## 🔍 Project Overview

This project is a **simulated version** inspired by a real scrap prediction model I developed during my role as an IPQC Engineer at **Murata Electronics**.  
The aim is to predict **Sn (Tin) thickness** in a plating process using features like:

- Bath Temperature  
- Current  
- Core weight

> **Note:** All data used in this project is **generated and does not reflect any real production data**.

## 🚀 What’s in This Project

- Performed **exploratory data analysis** & correlation matrix
- Built **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regression** models
- Applied **K-Fold Cross Validation**
- Visualized **actual vs predicted Sn thickness**
- Evaluated performance using **RMSE** and **R² score**

---

## 📈 Model Performance (Random Forest + KFold)
- Average **R² Score**: ~0.92  
- Average **RMSE**: ~0.97
